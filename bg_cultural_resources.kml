di ciascuno, coordinano l’acquisizione, la conservazione, la pubblica fruizione dei beni culturali museali e condividono iniziative. Il Sitema Culturale Integrato Coordina 
l’acquisto librario delle biblioteche per differenziare il patrimonio documentario complessivo, organizza varie iniziative culturali e crea e promuove nuovi servizi per le 
biblioteche. <br>

L'azienda Agricola Castolda propone una fattoria didattica dove è possibile abbinare l'apprendimento teorico a quello pratico.
L'obiettivo è di trasmettere le informazioni relative all'attività agricola, alla vita animale, ai mestieri e alle tecniche applicate per la produzione degli alimenti, educando 
nel contempo al consumo ed al rispetto dell'ambiente, in uno scenario reale e naturale.
E' stato inoltre allestito un piccolo museo contadino in cui l'esposizione vuole essere la documentazione di un passato che non può essere dimenticato poiché si vuole ricordare 
come l'uomo abbia vissuto prima di noi, con quali mezzi, con quali strumenti, con quale genere di vita.<br>

Il Campanile di Treviglio in stile gotico lombardo è stato edificato, per scopi civili, intorno all'anno 1008, prospiciente alla basilica di San Martino.  Presenta una struttura 
quadrangolare, con pareti abbellite da una decorazione ad archetti pensili. Con i suoi 68 metri di altezza, è il simbolo per eccellenza dell'intera città. Oggi l'obiettivo è 
quello di attuare importanti interventi di restauro per destinare la Torre ad alloggiare spazi museali. <br>

Il nucleo principale dell'attuale palazzo municipale, già menzionato nei documenti del 1269 come pallatium novum communitatis, fu terminato nel 1300. Nel 1700 l'edificio fu unito 
all'adiacente chiesa di San Giuseppe, edificata dall'omonima confraternita nel 1509, mantenendo l'elegante porticato dell'edificio sacro. Dopo essere diventato di proprietà del 
Comune, nel 1873 il palazzo venne alzato di un piano e le varie sale furono adibite a uffici pubblici. <br>

La Fattoria Didattica Cascina Pezzoli è uno spazio di esperienza del mondo agricolo dedicato a chiunque voglia avvicinarsi alle origini dei prodotti che si trovano sulla nostra 
tavola attraverso momenti di visita, laboratori e contatto con la realtà rurale. L’azienda alleva bovini da latte e carne e offre ai visitatori l’opportunità di conoscere 
l’evoluzione dell’allevamento e dell’agricoltura moderna.Inoltre un piccolo museo dedicato agli strumenti di un tempo (oggetti di scuola, giochi, arnesi della casa e della 
campagna) consente di volgere uno sguardo al passato per riscoprire la civiltà contadina nella prima metà degli anni Cinquanta.<br>

Posto di fronte al Santuario della Beata Vergine delle Lacrime, ospitò i fratelli Galliari e diede in seguito il nome a tutta la via che ad essi risultò intitolata. Il palazzo, 
recentemente ristrutturato, anche in seguito al crollo di un edificio adiacente, presenta un portale in pietra e un ampio androne dipinto. Il cortile interno è dotato di una 
fontana, e le sale del palazzo, che è posto su due piani, sono affrescate. <br>

L' edificio si sviluppa intorno ad un ampio cortile che permette il collegamento con il vicolo Teatro. Si accede alla dimora da una porta che immette in un corridoio che funge da 
collegamento tra i piani superiori, il cortile ed il portico, elemento di filtro tra lo spazio aperto e le stanze alpiano terreno, dove sono state rinvenuti i resti di una delle 
torri e del
camminamento dell’antico castrum vetus. L’elemento caratterizzante il palazzo
sono gli affreschi con vedute prospettiche qui lasciati dai Galliari, proprietari
dell’immobile nel sec. XVIII.  <br>

Il nome di Bergamo deriva probabilmente da
Bèrghem
, che significa "insediamento sul colle. La
Città Alta ne è ormai divenuta l’icona, scrigno di
gioielli architettonici unici al mondo, sede
di musei e pinacoteche, vicoli e negozi antichi, ri
storanti caratteristici e botteghe, che
convive perfettamente con la Città Bassa, dove sono
la moda e il design, la vita mondana e
l'imprenditoria, ma anche l’arte e la cultura a car
atterizzare il territorio. <br>

Esempio unico di villaggio operaio per via della sua posizione privilegiata e del suo stile architettonico e urbanistico inalterato, Crespi d'Adda testimonia il periodo più 
cruciale dell'evoluzione della società moderna: la rivoluzione industriale. Nel 1995 è entrato a far parte della Lista del Patrimonio dell'umanità dell'Unesco. <br>

<div class="box"><br> La Valle Taleggio merita di essere percorsa e visitata nella sua interezza e pertanto non si può prescindere dall'uso dell'automobile. Le sensazioni più 
penetranti però restano quelle che si assaporano percorrendo a piedi le antiche mulattiere, cogliendo tutti i particolari di un ambiente che mantiene ancora una dimensione genuina 
e semplice. Alcuni antichi borghi hanno mantenuto inalterata l’architettura, gli alpeggi dominano il paesaggio e i sapori della cucina e della tavola non hanno mai ceduto alla 
“modernizzazione” del gusto. Tra questi il Borgo di Fraggio. <br>

<div class="box"><br> Dopo le ultime case di Carona, ai margini della strada che porta la rifugio CalviCarona, ai margini della strada che porta al Rifugio Calvi spunta sulla 
destra, da una piccola quanto suggestiva radura, la Frazione di Pagliari.  Un borgo antico, fra i meglio conservati nella sua architettura rustica, che d'inverno appare come un 
unico sasso compatto e scuro, che si distingue sul tappeto immacolato della neve, mentre d'estate si stempera all’interno di un paesaggio più dolce e variegato, dove le lingue 
verdi dei pascoli e dei prati s’insinuano fra le stradine e i viottoli, dentro i suoi spazi aperti. Siamo nell’ultima valle dell'alto Brembo, epicentro di un’area culturale e 
commerciale fitta di sentieri e tracciati di comunicazione fra una valle e l'altra. L’unicità del luogo ci permette di considerare il museo una risorsa S-low. <br>

<div class="box"><br> Pusdosso, posta a 1038 metri di quota, è la frazione più alta del Comune di Isola di Fondra, ed è la più popolata: 7 sono i residenti, cui si aggiungono 
almeno una ventina di persone nei fine settimana e nel periodo estivo. Il Borgo di Pusdosso, come tutti i paesi dell'alta valle ed anche le frazioni, nel dopoguerra, ha subito una 
forte migrazione. Caratteristica è la disposizione dell'abitato con la chiesetta dei Santi Valentino e Pantaleone, le solide case di pietra addossate le une alle altre e, più 
distanti, le stalle. La disposizione serrata delle case è stata causa di frequenti e gravi incendi: si ricorda ancora quello che colpì la frazione alla fine del 1800 e che causò 
la distruzione di alcune abitazioni, i cui resti sono visibili nella piazzetta. <br>

Meritano un cenno, per la loro singolare bellezza dovuta alle caratteristiche ambientali e storico-architettoniche, Colle Palazzo e le Stalle del Möschel. L’economia della 
località in passato era basata esclusivamente sullo sfruttamento delle risorse agricole e forestali. Oggi la popolazione trova occupazione nelle fabbriche del fondo valle, nel 
campo dell’artigianato e dei servizi ed in misura alquanto ridotta nell’agricoltura e nello sfruttamento del bosco. A quota 1267 m. nel territorio della parrocchia di Valzurio 
abbiamo una delle località più incantevoli della valle: Colle Palazzo, un aperta ed estesa prateria che fa da spartiacque tra il versante sud di Valzurio e quello a nord di 
Ardesio in frazione Ave. Colle Palazzo, in epoca antica ebbe un’ importanza rilevante in quanto fu un luogo di commercio e di mercato, in particolare di bestiame, di lana, di 
latticini e scambio di merci varie. Qui giungevano gente dall’alta valle Seriana, dalla valle di Scalve e ancora dalla Valtellina e perfino dalla Svizzera e dalla Germania. <br>

<div class="box"><br>La contrada Cacciamali un tempo vivace e prospera per le sue antiche miniere argentifere e feudo di una nobile ed antica famiglia ardesiana, da cui appunto 
prese il nome, oggi è completamente spopolata. Situata all’altitudine di 1.100 m. è servita da una disagevole via di accesso. Ciò non ha però impedito che nel corso degli anni si 
realizzassero numerosi interventi di restauro e risanamento edilizio, che hanno portato alla luce una pregevole architettura. Così nelle lunghe giornate la contrada torna a vivere 
come un tempo. Vi si trova una bellissima chiesetta del XVI secolo con affreschi risalenti allo stesso periodo. Antiche e bellissime abitazioni di montagna creano l’incanto di 
Ave. Anche in questo caso l’elevata altitudine (1.100 m.) ed il crollo dell’economia agro-silvo-pastorale montana sono alla base del completo abbandono, solo ora ai primi 
tentativi di recupero. La sua splendida posizione e le ricche abetaie che la circondano sono infatti la ragione di un sia pur modesto (4 abitanti) rinsediamento abitativo.

Maslana è un antico insediamento rurale, che si adagia sulle soleggiate pendici meridionali che scendono dal Pizzo Coca la più alta vetta delle Alpi Orobie, con i suoi 3052 m. E' 
costituita da 4 distinti gruppi di baite, ad altezza compresa tra i 1150 m. e i 1200 m. Il più basso e il più grande è chiamato Polli. Vi sono 22 unità abitative, di dimensioni 
diverse, raggruppate in quattro blocchi di edifici a due e a tre piani. Vi è una fontana, alimentata da una sorgente sotterranea, proprio all'inizio del borgo, vicino al 
fabbricato a un piano utilizzato una volta, sino a qualche decina d'anni fa, come casera. Veniva qui prodotto il formaggio ricavato dal latte fornito dalle mucche che pascolavano 
nei prati vicini. Nella parte alta della contrada c'è un'attività di ristoro con un servizio di piccole
ristorante di montagna e la possibilità di pernottamento in alcune camere recentemente ristrutturate.

a valle, appare davvero grazioso il nucleo antico della frazione Colarete ove spiccano alcune case rustiche ben conservate e la locale chiesetta dedicata a San Michele, dal tetto 
in ardesia (XV secolo). All’interno conserva affreschi davvero unici, che coprono quasi integralmente il presbierio e la parete sinistra della navata, insieme a tele del 
Carpinoni. In quanto borgo caratteristico antico costruito in materie locale, ardesia, possiamo considerarlo risorsa s-Low.<br>

<div class="box"><br> Nell'abitato di Pizzino attorno al santuario ci sono boschi e pascoli, incantevoli panorami  e dolci colori. La tradizione vuole che tutti gli abitanti di 
Taleggio vi salgono la seconda festa di Pasqua: prima la messa, poi la colazione sul prato con uova e radicchio. Dell'antico castello di Pizzino non e' rimasta traccia: sorgeva su 
un alto picco dove si trova ora un gruppo di case assai caratteristiche. Un reperto archeologico, custodito presso la parrocchiale, reca scolpita a caratteri romanici la data MX. 
E' una pietra con croce, forse una chiave di volta, che si assicura appartenesse alla primitiva chiesa di S. Ambrogio, sorta intorno al Mille, la più antica della Valle Taleggio.

Castel Cerreto è un borgo situato a nord del territorio di Treviglio e piuttosto isolato dal centro. È un borgo prevalentemente agricolo, immerso nella campagna che conta circa 
380 abitanti ed è accessibile tramite una porta turrita,memoria del quattrocentesco complesso fortificato,appartenente prima alla famiglia nobiliare milanese Rozzone e poi alla 
famiglia Piazzoni. Abitato già in epoca romana, Castel Cerreto divenne insediamento agricolo nel 1539 per volere dei Rozzone.

La storia di Lovere è ricchissima di avvenimenti, vista la sua posizione strategica che lo colloca tra l'alto Sebino e l’imbocco della val Cavallina per i collegamenti via terra, 
ed all’estremità nord del lago d’Iseo per i trasporti via acqua. Splendidi palazzi costruiti con buon gusto e perfetto senso architettonico, fanno da secoli degna cornice e 
splendida corona alla piazza del porto, una delle più belle dei laghi Lombardi.<br>

L’ecomuseo onora il grande Leonardo da Vinci, vissuto nella villa di Vaprio d’Adda, ospite del suo allievo prediletto Francesco Melzi, a cui lasciò molti dei suoi scritti, 
documenti, disegni. E’ in questi luoghi che approfondì i suoi studi, le sue osservazioni sulla natura, creò invenzioni ardite e lasciò impronte del suo genio.<br>

L’Ecomuseo di Valtorta promuove il coinvolgimento e la partecipazione attiva della popolazione in quanto rappresenta l’espressione della cultura del territorio ed ha come 
principale riferimento la comunità locale. Il Museo Etnografico che raccoglie le testimonianze di secoli di vita locale, costituisce certamente l’aspetto più significativo del 
vasto complesso di richiami alla civiltà deI passato ma accanto al museo c’è l’intero borgo; ci sono i resti, oggi recuperati, del maglio, delle fucine, dei mulini e delle 
miniere; ci sono i dipinti murali, le solennità religiose e le sagre popolari e non mancano le prelibatezze di una cucina semplice e genuina.<br>

L'Ecomuseo Centro Storico - Borgo Rurale di Ornica sin dalla sua istituzione nel 2009 ha coinvolto l’intera Comunità allo scopo di garantire in modo continuativo, sul magnifico 
territorio di Ornica, le funzioni di salvaguardia, conservazione, rivalutazione e promozione della cultura tipicamente contadina del luogo, con recupero delle tradizioni e dei 
modi di vita che si sono succeduti nel corso dei secoli.<br>

La Val Taleggio, una piccola valle chiusa nel cuore delle prealpi Orobiche sulla riva destra del fiume Brembo a 800 metri di quota, è caratterizzata da un paesaggio ricco di 
prati, boschi, acque, disegnato da una millenaria attività agricola, casearia e forestale, e da un clima che si mantiene per lo più mite anche d’inverno.<br>

L’Ecomuseo delle Miniere di Gorno - il viaggio dello zinco tra alpeggi e miniere - nasce in primo luogo con l’intento di rinsaldare il legame della comunità locale con le proprie 
radici, la propria storia e le proprie tradizioni. Tale obiettivo si sta attuando attraverso interventi di ricerca, salvaguardia e valorizzazione della cultura e del territorio.

L’Ecomuseo coinvolge il territorio della Comunità Montana di Scalve e parte dei territori confinanti della Comunità Montana di Valle Seriana Superiore e Valle Camonica, in 
provincia di Bergamo e Brescia. L’elemento catalizzatore è l’ex statale 294 “Strada verde”, attorno ad essa si è delineato un “Museo Ambiente”, reticolo d’attività sviluppatesi 
attraverso il patrimonio territoriale ed i saperi delle popolazioni che, da risorse indifferenziate, diventano giacimento culturale fruibile da tutti. <br>

L'impianto medioevale di Cologno al Serio presenta un buon esempio di borgo fortificato.Il vecchio nucleo abitato era protetto dal fossato colmo d'acqua, dalle mura merlate, dalle 
quattro torri e dalla rocca, ancora ben conservati. Ancora oggi l'accesso all'abitato è assicurato da quattro porte ricavate nel corpo massiccio di altrettanti torrioni muniti in 
origine di ponte levatoio e disposti secondo i punti cardinali.<br>

Castrum Vetus, ossia Castello Vecchio, non identifica un castello bensì il nucleo centrale fortificato che all’epoca medioevale era ubicato tra le attuali Piazza Manara, Piazza 
Garibaldi e Via Galliar ed era munito di torri e di una porta d’ingresso, circondata da un fossato. Successivamente la crescita della popolazione fece sì che sorgessero 
successivamente cinte murarie a difesa della prosperità cittadina.

successivamente un villaggio. Di origine medievale sono infatti i resti del castello di Capersegno ancora circondato da abitazioni coeve, utilizzate dai coloni. Nel medioevo il

<div class="box"><br>La Rocca di Cividate è un vero e proprio castello risalente ad un periodo compreso tra il XII ed il XIII secolo. Questo conserva ancora numerose 
caratteristiche dell'epoca medievale, tra cui una torre, un fossato e l'ingresso dove un tempo vi era un ponte levatoio.  A testimonianza di questa fortificazione si conservano 
oggi alcuni tratti di muro in ciottoli fluviali disposti a spina di pesce, tracce di fossati e resti del portale d'ingresso. Il complesso possedeva molto probabilmente un impianto 
quadrangolare con doppia cinta di mura; quella esterna aveva forse quattro torri d'angolo e l'ingresso, munito di ponte levatoio, si apriva sul lato meridionale.<br>

Viene denominato Castello il nucleo centrale e più antico del paese, un vero e proprio borghetto fortificato, caratterizzato da case medievali disposte attorno alla irregolare 
piazza Castello e lungo la strada che la raggiunge dopo aver oltrepassato un portale d’ingresso recante nella chiave di volta le insegne di Bartolomeo Colleoni. Il castello fu 
eretto nel X secolo dagli eredi di Giselberto I, i Ghisalbertini, estromessi dalla città per il crescente potere vescovile. Tra il XII e il XIII sec. i Colleoni di Martinengo 
eressero un'imponente casaforte che si sviluppa fino a ventotto metri di altezza; dal suo spigolo sudoccidentale s'innalza una torre a pianta quadrata che la tradizione 
attribuisce a Bartolomeo Colleoni.<br>

<div class="box"><br>Il Castello sorse lungo la strada proveniente da Borgo di Terzo. Ha una disposizione ad L, con due corpi di fabbrica disposti lungo i lati meno difesi 
naturalmente e una torre posta lungo il lato nord, nel punto dove i due corpi si accostano. La torre del castello, attualmente visibile solo per la parte superiore, si presenta 
piuttosto bassa e con copertura a due falde. Si può pensare ad un ridimensionamento in altezza, compiuto forse nel corso del ‘400, quando il signore locale, Iacobo Suardi, subì, 
con l’avvento della Repubblica di Venezia, la confisca di tutti i beni.<br>

<div class="box"><br>Il castello sorgeva a controllo dell'accesso romano sul fiume Brembo. Il complesso di edifici si articola attorno ad un piccolo cortile, delimitato sul lato 
settentrionale dalla chiesa di San Michele, probabilmente di fondazione longobarda. Le murature sono in conci squadrati di pietra arenaria nel basamento e sugli spigoli, mentre le 
parti interne sono in ciottoli di fiume disposti a spina di pesce. Epoca di costruzione: sec. XI - sec. XII.<br>

Come ci hanno tramandato i documenti trecenteschi, l’organismo castellano occupava l’intero isolato quadrilatero compreso tre le attuali vie dei Prati, Campagnola, Domenico Savio 
e Pacino da Nova, strade che hanno sostituito fossati o rogge che assolvevano a quella funzione. L’assetto originario del castello, precisamente riconoscibile nonostante la 
complessa stratificazione di edifici che l’ha avvolto a partire dal XIV secolo, era di notevole chiarezza distributiva e univa sapientemente l’efficacia degli apprestamenti 
difensivi con le esigenze di una sofisticata residenza signorile.<br>

L’edificio di maggior rilievo di Luzzana è il castello. I resti delle prime strutture, tra cui la torre, il portale, alcuni particolari del muro e le varie porticine, fanno 
risalire la costruzione del castello alla fine del XIII secolo. Verso la fine del 1500, questo vecchio maniero fu trasformato in abitazione civile dai Conti Giovanelli. Il 
Castello ora ospita il municipio.<br>

L'edificio, trasformato in palazzo padronale, tradisce tuttora, nel volume compatto e nell'alta torre angolare l'oroginaria matrice castellana. Se ne hanno notizie dal 1329. 
Dall'Ottocento è di proprietà Terzi di Sant'Agata. Oggi il castello si presenta come un volume ancora isolato di impianto quadrangolare, fittamente edificato su tutti i lati. 
L'esterno è spoglio, con le sole emergenze del severo portale d'ingresso e dell'alta torre che domina l'angolo nord-ovest.<br>

Nel centro di Castel Rozzone, borgo situato in posizione strategica a sud del Fosso Bergamasco, vi è una grande corte quadrangolare, porticata internamente, con resti di torri 
angolari: è ciò che permane dell'antico castello, oltre il toponimo. Il complesso venne eretto dalla famiglia Rozzone, originaria di Treviglio, nel XIII sec., e poi ampliato dai 
Visconti nel corso del '300.<br>

La villa incorpora le strutture di un preesistente castello medioevale, forse appartenente a un più vasto complesso fortificato che si estendeva su gran parte del paese. E' 
formato da un complesso di edifici con torri che si articolano attorno a un cortile centrale di pianta rettangolare. All'interno vari locali con volte lunettate ed a crociera, 
alcune con archi gotici. La cappella gentilizia con decorazioni barocche presenta all'interno un pregevole altorilievo trecentesco. La facciata è arricchita da un portale 
rinascimentale. Nel giardino pregevoli essenze secolari. Attualmente la dimora è sede dell’importante Associazione Giovanni Secco Suardo.<br>

<div class="box"><br>Le mura vennero costruite dalla Repubblica di Venezia nella seconda parte del XVI secolo, epoca in cui la città orobica rappresentava l'estremità occidentale 
dei domini veneti sulla terraferma. La decisione definitiva sul progetto venne ratificata dal senato veneto nel 1561, Alcuni tratti di fortificazione erano già presenti in epoca 
romana, dei quali sono rimaste alcune tracce ancora oggi visibili. l'opera venne conclusa soltanto nel 1588, ben ventisette anni dopo, La struttura, che nel corso degli anni ha 
subito pochi interventi di modifica, ha uno sviluppo pari a sei chilometri e duecento metri. La cinta muraria è costituita da 14 baluardi, 2 piattaforme, 32 garitte (di cui solo 
una è giunta sino a noi), 100 aperture per bocche da fuoco, due polveriere, 4 porte (Sant'Agostino, San Giacomo, Sant'Alessandro e San Lorenzo, ora intitolata a Giuseppe 
Garibaldi).<br>

A seguito della Pace di Lodi del 1453 tra il Ducato di Milano e la Repubblica Veneta, Francesco Sforza commissiona al figlio Tristano la costruzione di una torre di guardia del 
confine che seguirà il corso del fiume Oglio tra Soncino e Pumenengo. L'imponente torre, detta di Tristano, venne così eretta sulle terre dei Conti Barbò, feudatari dei luoghi sin 
dal 1070, in contrapposizione a Roccafranca, posta sul lato veneto del fiume. Nello stesso luogo, un secolo più tardi, Adalberto Marchese Pallavicino decise di costruire una 
sontuosa dimora. Il Palazzo divenne poi dimora dei Conti Barbò che tuttora lo possiedono. Oggi ospita cerimonie matrimoniali, riunioni societarie ed eventi.<br>

Nella cornice del Parco del fiume Oglio è situato il Castello Silvestri, con il suo parco di oltre un ettaro di verde in cui ancora oggi è ben visibile l’impostazione del 
‘giardino formale’. L'edificio sorge sulle rovine di una villa romana del I sec. Ne è testimonianza la pavimentazione a mosaico di straordinaria fattura, rinvenuta nel 1870 nelle 
cantine del castello, che, ritenuto il miglior esempio di arte romana di tutta la provincia bergamasca, è oggi visibile al Museo Archeologico di Bergamo. La costruzione del 
castello iniziò verso l'anno 1000 e fu a lungo conteso dalla Repubblica di Venezia e dal Ducato di Milano. Nel 1862 lo acquistò Giacomo Silvestri. Oggi il castello è una residenza 
privata, ma viene affittato per congressi e matrimoni. <br>

perché sopra i locali destinati alle botteghe al piano terra, vi sono degli appartamenti destinati ai più bisognosi. Questa funzionalità è mantenuta ancora oggi 
dall’amministrazione comunale. Proprio all’inizio dei Portici si nota un banco in marmo, ritenuto di epoca romana, su cui nel Medioevo si vendeva il pesce: da questa funzione è 
rimasto il nome con cui lo si indica, nonostante lo spostamento dal centro della piazza al fianco della stessa.<br>

del paese. Quelli più evidenti sono costituiti dalle tracce della merlatura visibili sotto la gronda. La muratura è costituita in prevalenza da ciottoli del Serio nelle parti più 
basse (e forse più antiche) dell'edificio e da filari di ciottoli alternati a mattoni nelle parti più elevate.<br>

Il castello fu probabilmente eretto dal nell’Alto Medioevo dal prevosto-feudatario della pieve di San.Lorenzo a difesa degli edifici sacri e della Canonica. Munito di un unico 
accesso con ponte levatoio, successivamente anche il centro abitato fu circondato da fossato e terrapieno. Il castello e il villaggio furono incendiati e semidistrutti da una 
banda di ghibellini nel 1398. Poche tracce restano oggi del terrapieno e del fossato del borgo, mentre il castello conserva parte delle mura in ciottoli di fiume e resti di una 
torre a pianta quadrata; un’altra torre è inserita nella casa parrochiale.<br>

L'edificio si innalza dal suolo per cinque piani e presenta una muratura in blocchi squadrati di arenaria fino a circa un terzo della sua altezza, quindi i corsi di pietra si 
alternano a filari di ciottoli del Brembo disposti a spina di pesce, questi poi costituiscono il paramento murario della parte terminale, mentre i cantonali proseguono in pietra. 
Questa torre è l'unica testimonianza rimasta di un complesso fortificato a corte demolito nel 1908 per la costruzione degli stabilimenti industriali "Dalmine".<br>

Tra le numerose testimonianze storico-artistiche si segnala anche la torre civica, costruita nel 1492 su ordine di Ludovico Sforza, duca di Milano, allo scopo di controllare i 
territori della Repubblica di Venezia situati al di là del fiume Serio. Interamente in mattoni, è alta 42 metri ed è caratterizzata da una sommità merlata. Ha forma quadrangolare 
con base leggermente scarpata. È dotata di aperture ad arciera e a balestriera, realizzate a scopo difensivo. La struttura è stata adibita nel XIX secolo a campanile mediante 
l'aggiunta di campane, dei quattro quadranti dell'orologio e dei meccanismi interni. Attualmente la torre è in uso alla parrocchia.<br>

Sorge in angolo ad un quadrilatero di fabbricati che nel lontano passato rappresentarono una specie di fortilizio. E' infatti protetta tutt'intorno da edifici e non prospetta 
sulla strada. Si eleva di circa 25 metri, tutta in pietra, con copertura ordinaria a tetto. E' una costruzione storicamente interessante, oggi di proprietà della nobile Anna 
Naddeo Astori e sede del museo storico.<br>

La Casa, situata al centro del nucleo più antico del paese, costituisce, con la torre posta sulla spigolo, uno dei lati rimasti relativamente integro di un antico fortilizio, di 
epoca medioevale. Si innalza per quattro piani e presenta una struttura muraria in ciottoli di fiume disposti a spina di pesce alternati a corsi di mattoni, mentre gli spigoli 
sono in pietra arenaria squadrata. Il medesimo materiale è usato anche per i contorni di una finestra. Al piano terra della torre esiste un ambiente coperto con un'interessante 
volta a crociera imposta su mensole angolari.<br>

Le fonti trecentesche riportano entrambi i nuclei di Tresolzo (sopra e sotto), con la qualifica di castrum. Le parti più interessanti si colgono ora in via San Zenone, dove si 
eleva un’alta torre, eseguita nella consueta tecnica locale in ciottoli di fiume con grandi cantonali in arenaria e belle finestre in arenaria di Mapello. br>

La posizione del castello di Pumenengo ha caratterizzato anche la sua planimetria: situato su un terrapieno lambito dal Naviglio Pallavicino, sovrastante la vallata che conduce al 
fiume Oglio, il castello non presenta la classica pianta quadrata con una torre per angolo che, invece, caratterizza gli altri edifici fortificati di pianura. La pianta del 
castello di Pumenengo è trapezoidale e presenta solamente tre torri. Le notizie storiche relative al castello risalgono al XVI sec., ma è moltoprobabile che quanto vediamo noi 
oggi sia l’ampliamento di una precedente fortificazione ancora più antica, resasi necessaria a causa dei continui conflitti che si generavano con i borgo di Rudiano a causa del 
controllo sul passaggio del fiume.<br>

Mura di epoca medievale, scorci rinascimentali, decori di gusto neoclassico. Si leggono le tappe di una storia complessa sui muri del castello Camozzi-Vertova che domina Costa di 
Mezzate, borgo ancora agricolo di quel territorio collinare denominato val Calepio, compreso tra i fiumi Cherio e Oglio. Lo scenografico complesso si compone infatti di edifici e 
corpi di fabbrica realizzati a più riprese, a partire dal XIII sec. fino al XVIII, e restaurati nell'Ottocento.<br>

Il castello di Urgnano venne costruito nel 1354, dopo che il governo del Ducato di Milano, morto Luchino Visconti, era passato nelle mani del fratello Giovanni. Fra il '300 e il 
'400 fu teatro di lotte fra le fazioni che si combatterono in questo terre. Divenne di proprietà di Venezia nel 1428, quando Bergamo passò spontaneamente sotto il dominio della 
Repubblica della Serenissima. Alla morte di Bartolomeo Colleoni, il castello passò alla famiglia degli Albani. Il castello ha una struttura a pianta quadrata, con quattro torri 
agli angoli, con altre due sopra le porte d'ingresso. E' circondato dal fossato, efficace difesa contro i nemici. E' realizzato interamente in cotto, secondo una tradizione che 
risale all'età viscontea.<br>

Il vecchio borgo medievale di Calepio è dominato dal castello originariamente costruito intorno all'anno 1000 dai feudatari del posto che, dall'anno 1240, iniziarono a chiamarsi 
Conti di Calepio. Il castello venne poi ricostruito nel 1430 e vide le gesta del condottiero Trussardo da Calepio che, nella guerra tra i milanesi e i veneziani, scelse di 
allearsi con la Repubblica di Venezia sconfiggendo le truppe Viscontee.<br>

Venne costruito dal figlio primogenito della famiglia Ginami dei Licini nel 1246 in una zona particolarmente favorevole dal punto di vista strategico: questo è infatti situato 
sullo sperone di una roccia in posizione elevata rispetto al piano dove scorre il Serio, punto di passaggio obbligato, d'avvistamento e di difesa. La struttura muraria risale al 
XVI secolo; è rimasta quasi intatta solo la torre del castello che sovrasta l'intero edificio.<br>

Il castello, posto al crocevia delle provincie di Milano, Bergamo e Brescia, risale al 1243. Fu acquistato nel 1470 da Bartolomeo Colleoni che apportò importanti variazioni e 
Francesco Martinengo Colleoni, discendente di Bartolomeo, conferì al castello l'attuale struttura. La dimora è caratterizzata da un grande cortile con doppio loggiato. Ora 
appartiene da oltre sessant’anni ai Principi Gonzaga di Vescovato, che ne stanno curando il minuzioso restauro.<br>

Il Castello di Grumello domina il borgo di Grumello del Monte e i suoi vigneti, nel cuore della Valcalepio, fascia collinare tra Bergamo e il lago d'Iseo. Fu costruito 
probabilmente intorno al Mille come fortezza militare dotata di torre d'avvistamento, data la sua posizione strategica. Nella seconda metà del ‘300 visse un periodo di lotte tra 
guelfi e ghibellini, mentre dal 1400 divenne teatro delle contese tra il Ducato di Milano e la Repubblica di Venezia. A partire dal XVIII sec. il castello fu trasformato in 
residenza patrizia dallo stile semplice e austero. Da allora è stato proprietà di diversi nobili casati: i conti Suardo, i marchesi Del Carretto, i principi Gonzaga di Vescovado. 
Dal 1953 appartiene all’azienda agricola “Tenuta Castello di Grumello del Monte" che tutt'oggi ne cura i vigneti con i quali si produce, nelle cantine sottostanti il castello 
stesso, il pregiato vino "Valcalepio".<br>

Il castello di Malpaga si erge nelle campagne della bassa pianura bergamasca con il suo aspetto maestoso e imponente. Acquistato da Bartolomeo Colleoni nel 1456 dal Comune di 
Bergamo, fu successivamente trasformato nella sua principale residenza. Il castello è di forma quadrata, protetto da due cerchia di mura e da due fossati. Le pareti interne del 
castello sono quasi interamente affrescate e costituiscono non solo una viva e bellissima testimonianza artistica, ma anche delle usanze dell'epoca.<br>

In frazione Marne, nel comune di Filago, esiste uno dei luoghi più incantevoli e romantici della Lombardia. A più riprese, durante la dominazione Viscontea, il Castello di Marne è 
oggetto di contese, espugnazioni e distruzioni. Poi per tutto il tempo del governo della Repubblica di Venezia, il possesso del Castello da parte della famiglia Avogardi prosegue 
incontrastato fino al 1820, poi alla fine del XIX viene acquistato da un ramo della famiglia Colleoni e nel 1900 il castello restaurato in modo da trasformalo in residenza 
estiva.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> Adibito a location per ricevimenti/matrimoni. L'interno del castello è visitabile solo in occasione di mostre od esposizioni.<br>

I castello di Monasterolo, insieme a Bianzano e Mologno, faceva parte di un sistema difensivo medioevale, anche se probabilmente sorgeva sulle rovine di una precedente 
fortificazione. Nella seconda metà del XIII secolo il castello apparteneva alla potente famiglia ghibellina dei Suardi che ne fece solo un uso militare, o più precisamente era 
destinato al rigugio e alla difesa di beni mobili (animali e granaglie) in pericolo durante i frequenti passaggi degli eserciti. Nel secolo XVI, con l'aggiornamento al nuovo gusto 
rinascimentale, l'edificio venne adibito a residenza e quindi ingentilito. Verso la fine del 1700 il castello perse la sua importanza di fortezza-residenza e decadde rapidamente. 
La costruzione, trasformata in casa rustica, divenne un rudere rabberciato alla meglio e scese nell'oblio. Solo negli anni 1937-1939 la fortezza venne ristrutturata completamente 
da una nuova proprietaria: la contessa Winifred Terni de' Gregorj Taylor.<br>

In vetta al colle di Montecchio, l’edificio, oggi ubicato all’interno di un’area residenziale privata, fu trasformato alla fine del XVIII secolo dall’architetto austriaco Pollak. 
Sono ancora visibili le poderose mura di sostegno di un’antica fortificazione che qui dominava sulla valle Calepio e sull’Oglio, trasformata poi nel 1460 in monastero dei Padri 
Serviti. L’elegante chiostro quattrocentesco del monastero fu rinvenuto solo nel 1926 durante alcuni lavori di restauro dell’edificio. La torre che attualmente sovrasta il fu 
edificata nel 1862.<br>

L’attuale struttura risale all’inizio del XIV secolo, quando venne edificata in luogo di una precedente costruzione difensiva che avrebbe dovuto sorgere nei pressi della chiesa 
dedicata ai santi Nazario e Celso. La necessità di un castello difensivo dovuta alla forte instabilità politica nell’età medievale del borgo di Pagazzano e di tutta la pianura 
centrale bergamasca. Il castello presenta una pianta a sezione quadrata circondata da un fossato difensivo ancora oggi adacquato, unico esempio in tutta la bergamasca. La cinta 
muraria è perfettamente conservata e a protezione dell'ingresso, a cui si accedeva mediante ponte levatoio, svetta il mastio. Nel 2000 il Comune di Pagazzano lo ha acquistato 
iniziando i lavori di restauro.<br>

Situato a circa 500 m sopra il livello del mare, in una posizione che permette una splendida veduta panoramica del territorio circostante, il Castello di San Vigilio è sempre 
stato una struttura difensiva per i colli della città Orobica, porte d'accesso strategiche verso la città di Bergamo. Affacciandosi dal Castello è possibile controllare il 
vicinissimoMonte Bastia, e i paesi sottostanti.<br>

Il castello di Solza, noto per essere il luogo che, nel 1395, diede i natali a Bartolomeo Colleoni, è giunto a noi come il risultato di molteplici interventi che hanno plasmato un 
monumento che rispecchia la storia stessa dell’Isola bergamasca. Un monumento nel quale alle strutture militari, nobili e potenti, si sono sovrapposte le tracce di un vivere 
povero e contadino.<br>

Situato su uno sperone roccioso compreso tra il torrente Uria ed il fiume Oglio, il castello sovrasta una piana alluvionale in posizione discosta dal centro di Credaro.
La sua struttura, rimasta sostanzialmente inalterata nel corso dei secoli, è un esempio di come poteva essere una piccola cittadella medievale: presenta una forma a triangolo 
isoscele con la base, in cui è posto l'ingresso, rivolta verso est. Il lato nord-ovest è delimitato dal corso del torrente Uria, che in quel tratto presenta un profondo alveo che 
ha sempre garantito inaccessibilità.<br>

Sorge ai piedi del centro abitato ed è rivolto verso la Valle Cavallina, che domina con la sua imponenza. Il complesso, a due piani, ha robustezza di mura salde, di forma 
perfettamente quadrangolare con gli angoli orientati verso i quattro punti cardinali. E’ dominato da una torre incentrata nel lato d'ingresso e recintato da doppio ordine di mura, 
racchiudenti vallo e ponte levatoio, con due torrioni sporgenti dalle mura.<br>

Il castello di Liteggio, di origine medioevale, è posto nell'omonima località ai margini del centro abitato, venne fatto costruire nel XV secolo dai Visconti. Tuttora sono ancora 
visibili parti di muratura merlata ed il fossato, particolari che lo resero una fortificazione molto possente.<br>

Il castello originario è scomparso da secoli ma l'esistenza di questa fortificazione è certa grazie ad un documento che risale all'anno 1106. Sulle rovine di questa rocca venne 
successivamente edificato il Palazzo Vecchio che nel XVI secolo venne ampliato ed abbellito dai Sagramoro. Nel 1710 il Palazzo Vecchio venne totalmente ampliato con una 
appariscente solennità architettonica denominata Palazzo Nuovo.<br>

Nel 1355, appena conquistata Bergamo, Bernabò Visconti iniziò ad erigere sul Colle San Giovanni la Cittadella - la cosiddetta “Firma Fides” - imponente costruzione militare che 
doveva proteggere la parte occidentale della città. In realtà, sembra che lo scopo principale perseguito dal Visconti fosse quello di affermare visibilmente la propria signoria 
sulla città conquistata.<br>

Il complesso della Rocca, che ha avuto sin dalle origini destinazione militare, sorge sul colle di Sant’Eufemia in Bergamo alta, luogo di insediamenti celtici e romani. Il nucleo 
centrale è costituito da un mastio a pianta quadrangolare realizzato tra il 1331 e il 1336, che reca tracce delle numerose modifiche subite in relazione alle funzioni di presidio 
e carcere svolte sino ai primi decenni del Novecento.<br>

Il Fosso bergamasco è un canale artificiale situato nella pianura bergamasca di origine tardo medioevale che collega il fiume Adda al Serio per poi riprendere e collegare 
quest'ultimo all'Oglio.  Si ritiene che il fosso venne scavato tra la fine del XIII e l'inizio del XIV secolo, recuperando un antico canale romano già noto col nome di Circa di 
Cortenuova e prolungandolo fino all'Adda. L'importanza del fosso è data dal fatto che nel corso dei secoli venne sovente utilizzato come confine tra le diverse dominazioni del 
tempo, facendone così una zona al centro di contese e battaglie nell’età medievale e nelle epoche successive. In tempi recenti il percorso del fosso bergamasco è stato al centro 
di alcuni interventi di rivalutazione storica e ambientale, volti a conservarne il tracciato e a preservarlo dall’incuria. Difatti alcuni tratti, dopo essere stati asciugati, 
vennero abbandonati al proprio destino. <br>

Il Fosso bergamasco è un canale artificiale situato nella pianura bergamasca di origine tardo medioevale che collega il fiume Adda al Serio per poi riprendere e collegare 
quest'ultimo all'Oglio.  Si ritiene che il fosso venne scavato tra la fine del XIII e l'inizio del XIV secolo, recuperando un antico canale romano già noto col nome di Circa di 
Cortenuova e prolungandolo fino all'Adda. L'importanza del fosso è data dal fatto che nel corso dei secoli venne sovente utilizzato come confine tra le diverse dominazioni del 
tempo, facendone così una zona al centro di contese e battaglie nell’età medievale e nelle epoche successive. In tempi recenti il percorso del fosso bergamasco è stato al centro 
di alcuni interventi di rivalutazione storica e ambientale, volti a conservarne il tracciato e a preservarlo dall’incuria. Difatti alcuni tratti, dopo essere stati asciugati, 
vennero abbandonati al proprio destino. <br>

Il Mulino risale ai primi anni del 1300 ed è stato in funzione fino alla fine degli anni '90. Al suo interno conserva ancora tutti i macchinari in legno e acciaio: una macchina 
per la macinazione ancora in presente in loco risale prima dell'800. Il Mulino è da sempre meta didattica per le scolaresche della cttà e dei paesi limitrofi e ha recentemente 
conquistato la vetta della classifica dei luoghi del cuore della Fai nella categoria dedicata a Expo 2015. Vincere la classifica generale significherebbe ottenere i finanziamenti 
necessari per il restauro e per la realizzazione di un museo che spieghi la tradizione e la preparazione della polenta. <br>

Si tratta di un museo etnografico e archeologico fondato nel 1979 dal Comm. Vittorio Polli in collaborazione con un gruppo di amici protagonisti della cultura vallare bergamasca. 
La raccolta è costituita da un lato da reperti archeologici di notevole importanza, preziose testimonianze della vita nella nostra Valle in tempi remotissimi, e dall'altro da 
oggetti di epoche più recenti: attrezzi degli antichi mestieri, oggetti d'uso domestico, arredi, indumenti e pizzi, antichi divertimenti che permettono al visitatore di 
ricostruire le immagini di vita dei propri antenati.<br>
<br>

Il Museo Etnografico Alta Valle Brembana di Valtorta è nato e si è sviluppato con questo preciso intento: riscoprire e conservare il passato, valorizzare e trasmettere alle nuove 
generazioni le testimonianze di una civiltà e di una cultura. Una civiltà fatta di segni materiali (i luoghi, le case, i mobili, gli arredi, gli affreschi, gli strumenti di 
lavoro) ma anche e soprattutto di valori: quelli della fatica quotidiana, di una laboriosità pregna di ingegno e pazienza, di una fede genuina, di una semplicità e di una sobrietà 
di vita oggi del tutto inimmaginabili. Un Museo insomma attraverso cui esprimere l'essenza profonda della storia umana e sociale dell'Alta Valle Brembana.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> mar-dom 10-12 e 14.30-17.30. Lun chiuso. <br>

Il museo etnografico di Schilpario, nato per restituire alla popolazione un patrimonio storico e culturale essenziale per la conservazione della propria memoria storica, intende 
evidenziare soprattutto gli strumenti di lavori e gli oggetti della vita quotidiana, inserendoli nel contesto socio-economico in cui furono prodotti e usati. Gli oggetti, i 
documenti, le immagini fotografiche, le testimonianze orali qui presentate illustrano il lavoro incessante e faticoso che le condizioni ambientali e strutturali hanno imposto agli 
uomini e alle donne della Val di Scalve.<br>

Il comune di Oneta attualmente dispone di un museo dove sono raccolte numerose testimonianze del passato che consentono di riscoprire le antiche radici, percorrendo un cammino nel 
tempo e richiamando alla mente lontani ricordi. In una stanza situata nel seminterrato del Municipio sono esposti gli attrezzi di lavoro del mondo contadino, gli strumenti 
dell’attività mineraria, fotografie d’epoca e numerosi altri oggetti di varia natura, alcuni dei quali autentiche rarità archeologiche, recuperati e conservati grazie alla 
perseveranza del sig. Franco Epis.<br>

Il Museo Etnografico della Valle del Lujo è stato istituito, nel 1995, dal Gruppo Culturale «Amici di Casale», in collaborazione con il Comune di Albino e il sostegno della 
Comunità Montana Val Seriana, con il chiaro obiettivo di ricostruire la storia, le tradizioni di Casale e, più in generale, della Valle del Lujo. Il museo, unico nella zona per la 
sua specificità, si pone due obiettivi: da una parte, restituire alla popolazione un patrimonio storico e culturale essenziale alla conservazione della sua memoria storica; 
dall’altra, evidenziare attrezzi di lavoro, materiali, documenti e oggetti della quotidianità, inserendoli nel contesto socio-economico in cui furono prodotti e usati.<br>

Istituito nel 1982, il Museo Etnografico dell’Alta Valle Seriana si articola in quattro sezioni e analizza il rapporto secolare tra il territorio e le attività della popolazione 
della valle con riferimento alla filatura, al lavoro dei carbonai, dei muratori, dei boscaioli e dei minatori. Presenta documenti che ripercorrono la storia della miniera 
d’argento che sfruttò un giacimento scoperto nell’XI secolo e che rese famoso il paese. Comprende un' interessante cartografia storica, attrezzi e ricostruzioni della vita della 
miniera. A fianco della sede museale una casa di impianto quattrocentesco ospita ambientazioni di vita domestica, artigianato e agricoltura montana.<br>

Il progetto, iniziato negli anni Novanta, proseguito nel corso del tempo con la tradizione dell'affresco distribuito nelle vie del paese, annovera oggi circa 50 murales dai vari 
temi iconografici che raccontano Calcio nella sua storia e nei suoi aspetti di vita quotidiana: dai pastori che svernavano lungo le rive dell'Oglio alla vita agricola e rurale, 
dalla processione del Santo Patrono alla costruzione del primo ponte sul fiume; da Regina della Scala al passaggio della ferrovia; dai mulini alle prime illuminazioni a petrolio. 
Calcio fa parte dell'ASSIPAD (Associazione Italiana Paesi dipinti).<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> Il percorso è all'aperto, la visita è libera e richiede almeno due ore. <br>

All'illuminato spirito del conte Giacomo Carrara, mecenate, collezionista e profondo conoscitore del mondo delle lettere e delle arti, si deve l'origine della Pinacoteca, 
repertorio di forme e modelli già raccolto nella sua collezione privata che egli volle affiancare alla Scuola di Pittura in occasione del generoso lascito alla città di Bergamo 
perfezionato alla fine del Settecento. Il patrimonio del Museo, continuamente arricchito grazie ad acquisizioni e a donazioni da parte del collezionismo privato legato alla città, 
possiede attualmente 1800 dipinti, testimonianze di secoli compresi tra il XV e il XIX di artisti quali Pisanello, Botticelli, Bellini, Mantegna, Raffaello, Moroni, Baschenis, Fra 
Galgario, Tiepolo, Canaletto e Piccio.<br>

La GAMeC – Galleria d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Bergamo è uno dei centri di eccellenza dell'arte dell'Italia settentrionale. Inaugurata nel 1991, ha visto impegnati in unità 
di intenti il Comune di Bergamo e Credito Bergamasco nello sviluppo di politica di promozione dell'arte modera e contemporanea che ha permesso la realizzazione di un vero e 
proprio polo dell’arte, composto dalla Pinacoteca dell’Accademia Carrara, dall'Accademia di Belle Arti e dalla Galleria. Il Museo sviluppa, ricevendo donazioni e promuovendo 
acquisizioni, la propria Collezione Permanente, articolata in nuclei principali: la Raccolta Spajani, la Collezione Manzù e la Raccolta Stucchi. Ad esse si aggiungono opere di

Nel 1829 il conte Luigi Tadini fonda l’Istituto di belle arti Tadini, oggi noto come Accademia Tadini, composto di una galleria aperta al pubblico, dove esporre la propria 
raccolta d’arte, da una scuola di musica e da una scuola di disegno. La collezione raccolta dal conte Luigi Tadini rispecchia la varietà di interessi di un aristocratico cresciuto 
nel clima dell’Illuminismo lombardo che raccoglie, nella sua biblioteca opere di letteratura, filosofia, storia e scienze. L’Accademia è oggi composta da una Galleria - una tra le 
principali collezioni della Regione - e da una attiva Scuola di musica. Dal 1927 ospita una importante stagione concertistica, affidata a interpreti di altissimo livello. <br>

Il MAT "Museo Arte e Tempo" nasce nel 2005 nella sua sede del Palazzo Marinoni Barca con l’idea di esporre le opere pittoriche di artisti clusonesi provenienti da alcuni lasciti. 
In mostra, tra le gallerie e i soffitti affrescati del seicentesco palazzo, una ricca collezione di opere, tra dipinti, disegni, sculture e sbalzi di artisti clusonesi e non, 
provenienti dalle raccolte donate al Comune di Clusone dalle famiglie Sant'Andrea, Querena, Trussardi, Volpi e Nani. Il nucleo espositivo dedicato alla scultura espone due opere 
di Giacomo Manzù, che visse a Clusone negli anni difficili della guerra, e una serie di sbalzi e ritratti dello scultore Attilio Nani.<br>

<b>Orari di apertura:</b> ven 15.30-18.30, sab e dom 10-12 e 15.30-18.30 <br>

Nello spazio museale adiacente agli uffici e ai laboratori dell'azienda Tino Sana, è possibile curiosare in vere e proprie botteghe artigiane fedelmente ricostruite in tutti i 
particolari. Il mestiere del falegname, del carraio e perfino quello del liutaio tornano in vita grazie agli utensili, ai macchinari e ai prodotti finiti che qui sono esposti. 
Completa il museo una sala dedicata alle biciclette e tra queste un rarissimo esemplare della Draisina del 1820, naturalmente tutta in legno.<br>

Chiamato in questo modo per distinguerlo dagli opifici più piccoli, il Filandone viene costruito tra il 1873 e il 1876 dalla famiglia Daina per la lavorazione e la filatura della 
seta. L'architettura del Filandone ricorda quella delle chiese gotiche lombarde, con grandi finestre ad arco a sesto acuto. Anche l’alternanza del materiale di costruzione, il 
mattone e l’intonaco, serve a richiamare la bicromia delle architetture gotico-lombarde, così come l’imponente dimensione. Nel 2013 l'edificio completamente restaurato, è stato 
inaugurato e aperto al pubblico. Ospita la nuova biblioteca comunale di Martinengo. Il Filandone, come anche i portici del centro storico, è stato scelto da Ermanno Olmi per 
girare alcune scene de L'albero degli zoccoli.<br>

La Val di Scalve fu in passato uno dei principali poli minerari per l’estrazione di siderite (carbonato di ferro). L'attività estrattiva si sviluppò per secoli ed ebbe fine nella 
primavera del 1972.Nel 1997 la Cooperativa SKI MINE, costituita con lo scopo di rivalutare e trasmettere alle future generazioni la storia e la cultura mineraria della Valle di 
Scalve, ha realizzato un percorso museale all'interno del sotterraneo della miniera Berbera<br>

E’ nato con l’intento di salvaguardare il patrimonio storico e culturale legato alla escavazione, lavorazione e commercializzazione delle coti, le indispensabili pietre che 
servono per ridare il filo agli attrezzi da taglio, in particolare alla falce fienaia, la cui perfetta efficienza era essenziale nell'economia agricola tradizionale per 
l'approvvigionamento annuale dei foraggi. Nembro, Pradalunga e Albino furono per secoli i centri di produzione di pietre coti di qualità.<br>

I magli a Ponte Nossa sono collocati presso il fiume Nossa, affluente del Serio dalla portata notevole e costante. Il ferro estratto dalle miniere nelle vicine valli di Scalve e 
Bondione veniva trasportato presso il Maglio Fusore, nel quale era trasformato in metallo grezzo e verghe pronte per la forgiatura, che avveniva in altri tre magli (Minore, Grande 
e Maggiore). L'associazione Magli Nossa si propone di studiare e valorizzare la zona dei magli e la sua storia, con particolare attenzione alle molteplici possibilità formative e 
divulgative offerte da Maglio Beltrami, trasformato in museo negli anni '80.<br>

Il gruppo ha origine dalla passione di Pier Angelo Esposito, il quale da circa 40 anni colleziona pezzi unici provenienti dalle campagne e più in generale dalla tradizione 
bergamasca. Si tratta di più di 9000 pezzi fra attrezzi agricoli e artigiani, arredi e oggetti di vita quotidiana, casalinghi e strumenti di vecchi mestieri, reparti della prima e 
della seconda guerra mondiali, fotografie, cartoline e immagini sacre. Di grande valore storico e culturale sono le 18 biciclette da lavoro, ognuna che rappresenta un mestiere del 
passato.<br>

Il Palazzo del Podestà ha una lunga storia, strettamente legata alla vita politica della città. Sorto a fianco del Palazzo della Ragione, sede del potere civile, e del Vescovado, 
sede del potere religioso, il corpo di edifici che abbracciano la Torre del Campanone si affaccia sulle due piazze che hanno costituito il centro socio-politico di Bergamo tra 
l'epoca comunale (Piazza Duomo) e quella rinascimentale (Piazza Vecchia). In esso è stata allestita in forme interattive e multimediali la sezione relativa all’Età veneta del 
Museo storico, e in particolare il Cinquecento.<br>

La sezione ottocentesca del Museo storico di Bergamo, che ha ereditato il patrimonio storico e artistico del Civico Museo del Risorgimento e della Resistenza, è allestita dal 2004 
nel fabbricato all'interno del mastio della Rocca, costruito durante il dominio veneto per alloggiare gli artiglieri. Il mastio, in posizione elevata, offre una visuale a 360 
gradi sulla città e su alcune aree della provincia. Il percorso, organizzato in sezioni, parte dall'arrivo delle truppe francesi a Bergamo (1796) e tocca sino al 1870 i nodi 
tematici più significativi delle vicende del territorio bergamasco, in rapporto con la storia lombarda e nazionale.<br>

Edificato tra la fine del Duecento e l’inizio del Cinquecento, l’ex Convento di San Francesco rappresenta un esempio pregevole di architettura conventuale medievale, costruita 
intorno a chiostri. Dal 1997 il convento lega il suo nome al Museo storico di Bergamo: per cinque anni, fino al 2003, accoglie la sezione Ottocentesca del museo, ora presso la 
Rocca. Attualmente ospita, oltre a mostre temporanee, gli uffici, gli archivi, la biblioteca e la mediateca.<br>

Palazzo Agliardi sorge in uno degli antichi borghi di Bergamo ove nel '500 importanti famiglie di nobili e mercanti fecero costruire le loro dimore. Il palazzo fu fatto costruire 
nel XVI secolo da Alessandro Martinengo, nipote di Bartolomeo Colleoni. Nel 1845 venne acquistato dai Conti Agliardi, tuttora proprietari. La Dimora è visitabile per gruppi previo 
appuntamento. E' stata una delle dimore storiche di Dimore Design 2013. E' stata segnalata sul sito www.dimorestoricheitaliane.it. <br>

La presenza della famiglia Moroni a Stezzano risale alla metà del 1400 ma il nucleo più grosso delle acquisizioni terriere avviene a partire dagli inizi del 1600 per protrarsi 
nell'arco di due secoli con continui acquisti di fondi. Oggi è una splendida dimora adatta ad ospitare eventi di ogni genere. Le tre sale e il giardino esterno sono ottime per 
ospitare l'organizzazione di eventi di tutti i tipi.<br>

Situata ai piedi delle colline a dieci chilometri da Bergamo, la seicentesca Villa Pesenti-Agliardi fu ampliata e modificata nel 1798, su incarico del Conte Pietro Pesenti, da 
Leopold Pollack, con un progetto innovativo di reinterpretazione in chiave neoclassica sia della dimora che del giardino. E' stata segnalata sul sito

Villa Grismondi Finardi è ubicata all'interno dell'omonimo prestigioso quartiere-giardino che si estende intorno alla Villa e al suo maestoso Parco, a nord-est di Borgo Santa 
Caterina. Le origini del nucleo originario, riportato nelle antiche mappe come "Il Palazzo", risalgono almeno al XVI secolo. Appartenuta anticamente alle famiglie Biava e 
Cornolti, Villa Grismondi Finardi deve l´attuale denominazione alle famiglie nobili che vidimorarono: i Grismondi, nel Settecento, e i Finardi, antica famiglia nobile di Bergamo, 
che la possiede dalla metà Ottocento e che ancora oggi risiede nella Villa. E' stata una delle dimore storiche di Dimore Design 2013.<br>

Con il grandioso scalone d'ingresso e le sale affrescate, gli interni di Palazzo Moroni sono uno dei più interessanti esempi di arte barocca a Bergamo. All'esterno, la residenza, 
voluta da Francesco Moroni, è sobria ed elegante. Tra gli ambienti interni, di grande interesse artistico è la sala dedicata a Torquato Tasso, con decorazioni ispirate alla 
Gerusalemme Liberata, e la sala che richiama il mito dell’età dell’oro, ornata sul soffitto da affreschi raffiguranti Saturno. E' stata una delle dimore storiche di Dimore Design 
2013. <br>

L’imponente Palazzo Medolago Albani si trova in Via San Giacomo e costituisce un tipico esemplare di residenza borghese della Bergamo del tardo Settecento. L’edificio - di stile 
chiaramente neoclassico - fu costruito fra il 1783 e il 1791, su progetto dell’architetto Simone Cantoni. Acquistato nel 1841 dal Conte Giacomo Medolago, il palazzo è uno dei più 
signorili di Bergamo: nel corso dell’Ottocento ebbe ospiti illustri, quali l’imperatore d’Austria Francesco Giuseppe e il re Vittorio Emanuele II<br>

La Malga Lunga, situata in posizione dominante sui monti tra Sovere e Gandino, è una delle roccaforti partigiane del periodo resistenziale. Nel 1944 vi si insedia 53ma Brigata 
Garibaldi che assume il nome "Tredici Martiri di Lovere" in onore dei tredici martiri fucilati a Lovere il 22 dicembre 1943. Il 17 novembre 1944 la Malga viene attaccata di 
sorpresa da ingenti forze della Legione Tagliamento, che in seguito alla battaglia costringono alla resta i partigiani, i quali vengono in seguito giustiziati.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> sabato, domenica e festivi. Dal 7/7 al 28/9 tutti i giorni.<br>

La diga del Gleno oggi è una piacevole meta escursionistica per famiglie. In realtà questa imponente costruzione richiama alla memoria la tragedia che la vide coinvolta nel 1923, 
disseminando morte e distruzione in Val di Scalve e perfino in Val Camonica. Il grande bacino, che si affaccia sull'abitato di Bueggio, misura 4000 mq, 54 metri di profondità e 
260 metri di lunghezza e conteneva circa 7 milioni di metri cubi d'acqua. Il 1° dicembre del 1923, alle ore 7:15 la diga crollò. Sei milioni di metri cubi d'acqua, fango e detriti 
precipitarono dal bacino artificiale a circa 1500 metri di quota, dirigendosi verso il lago d'Iseo. I morti furono ufficialmente 356, ma i numeri sono ancora incerti.<br>

Il Museo di Civiltà Contadina venne fondato nel 1995 per volere di Vittore Paloschi che fu allora sindaco e donatore della maggior parte dei materiali esposti. La collezione è 
allestita in un’unica sala e gli oggetti sono sistemati in base all’loro utilizzo da quelli utilizzati per il lavoro contadino, agli attrezzi domestici fino agli oggetti per la 
filatura. Inoltre, il museo custodisce anche un raccolta di giocattoli degli anni ’30 del secolo scorso.<br>

Il museo è nato negli anni  '30 grazie all'impegno del conte Ercole Piccinelli che ha messo a disposizione lo stabile che ospita il museo. Il percorso museale si articola in sette 
sale e raccoglie oggetti, stampe, abiti d'epoca, documenti ufficiali e privati che ricostruiscono la storia di Seriate, e delle personalità locali più rappresentative, dall'Unità 
d'Italia fino alla seconda Guerra Mondiale. Tra gli oggetti esposti, merita particolare menzione una lettera autografa di Gabriele D'Annunzio. Le sette sale del museo sono 
allestite in un’ala della villa Piccinelli del 1600.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> 9,30 - 12,00 (I e III domenica del mese da maggio a settembre).<br>

Il museo raccoglie i cimeli militari delle varie guerre e delle fotografie dei caduti romanesi. Lo scopo era quello di onorare degnamente i concittadini caduti in battaglia. In 
continuo allestimento, il museo si articola in 3 sale comunicanti dove si trovano una ricca raccolta di medaglie, divise, bombe, armi e numerose fotografie e documenti ottenuti 
grazie a donazioni private e acquisti operati anche presso mercantini dell'usato e dell'antiquariato. Una cassetta completa del pronto soccorso della guerra del 1915/1918 e un 
apparecchio per visionare una quarantina di fotografie tridimensionali della prima guerra mondiale sono i due pezzi più pregiati della collezione. <br>

Il museo fu fondato nel 1872 per lascito testamentario di Adelaide Comelli, vedova di Giovan Battista Rubini, famoso tenore nato a Romano di Lombardia nel 1794 e morto nel 1854. 
Il museo è collocato nel palazzo Rubini, fatto costruire dall'artista nel 1845.Il museo occupa oggi cinque stanze contigue a piano terra. Nell'atrio sono esposte fotografie e 
litografie riguardanti il tenore.  Nella prima sala vi sono le memorie legate alla vita di Rubini e dei suoi più stretti familiari: ritratti, arredi, vesti. Nella seconda sala vi 
sono i ricordi di Rubini cantante. La terza sala raccoglie arredi e oggetti che decoravano gli ambienti dove viveva la famiglia. Presenta anche quadri che mostrano luoghi 
raggiunti dal tenore nella sua attività. Nella quarta sala, arredata come quadreria, sono esposte le moltissime stampe che Rubini acquistava nelle grandi capitali europee, oppure 
riceveva in dono.<br>

Gioiello dell’architettura rinascimentale e neoclassica, il palazzo appartenne a importanti casate del territorio bergamasco. La prima testimonianza documentaria sul palazzo 
risale al 1559, anno in cui i Furietti, ricchi mercanti residenti a Bergamo, acquistano il terreno su cui sorgerà l’edificio. Al piano terra la struttura conserva il suo aspetto 
rinascimentale, il piano nobile invece è frutto della sistemazione tardo settecentesca.<br>

Il Museo si prefigge, attraverso le opere del maestro Alberto Meli di far leggere alle nuove generazioni la cultura bergamasca vista attraverso gli occhi disincantati di un 
artista che ha dimostrato e dimostra una grande capacità di sintesi e che ha racchiuso nelle sue opere vigorosi messaggi mediati direttamente dalla tradizione. Lo scopo del museo 
quindi sarà quello di promuovere visite per testimoniare attraverso le opere esposte la cultura bergamasca della tradizione.<br>

Il Museo rappresenta una memoria storica della partecipazione degli abitanti di Grassobbio agli eventi bellici che hanno caratterizzato il XX secolo, in quanto è dedicato al 
ricordo di personaggi esclusivamente
originari del paese. Sono esposti in ampie e luminose bacheche, documenti, molti dei quali in originale, dedicati alle onorificenze che sono state attribuite ai cittadini di 
Grassobbio, sia per gli atti di valore compiuti in azioni militari (medaglie e croci al merito di guerra) sia per la partecipazione a questi avvenimenti (attestati di 
cavalierato), che sono stati raccolti, ed alcuni recuperati, grazie ad una approfondita e minuziosa ricerca presso le famiglie del luogo.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> sabato (ultimo di ogni mese)15.30-18.00; Negli altri giorni tramite accordi telefonici.<br>

Il Museo Storico, che si trova all’interno della torre, raccoglie gli oggetti che caratterizzavano la vita e il lavoro di tempi lontani. Viene presentato un percorso fotografico 
che mostra momenti di festa e di allegria, che erano il collante di rapporti umani semplici. Si possono ritrovare in questo percorso fotografico volti di persone e personalità che 
hanno fatto vivere la città di Orio. Le foto testimoniano una comunità impegnata in diverse attività ricreative.<br>

Nel marzo 1995, l’artista Rinaldo Pigola donò alla sua città natale, Romano di Lombardia, 42 opere da lui eseguite nell’arco di quasi cinquant’anni. Da qui nacque la collezione, 
attualmente ospitata nel Palazzo della Comunità (o Palazzo della Ragione). L’edificio trecentesco, è stato più volte rimaneggiato, in particolare nel ‘500 e nel ‘700; un’ultima 
ristrutturazione si è conclusa di recente. La collezione (intitolata anche alla moglie del donatore, Anita Dodesini, deceduta nel 1989) offre una panoramica del percorso artistico 
di Rinaldo Pigola, nato nel 1918 a Romano di Lombardia. Le opere sono esposte seguendo un ordine cronologico.<br>

Inizialmente era chiamato «Museo del Alpino», con il passare del tempo, grazie al lavoro di tante persone, e con varie ricerche il museo si ampliò con nuovo materiale, non solo 
alpino ma di tutti i corpi militari. Il materiale è vario, dalle armi alle divise, dai cappelli ai distintivi, alle fotografie e lettere dal fronte, compresi gli attestati con 
Croce di guerra dei nostri reduci di tutte le guerre.<br>

In un’epoca caratterizzata da flussi migratori planetari, di fronte a chiusure identitarie determinate dalla paura del diverso, questo museo intende essere un luogo di incontro e 
di dialogo tra le persone e le culture. I missionari Passionisti, proprietari della struttura, da oltre mezzo secolo presenti in Africa, si sono interrogati sulle cause dello 
squilibrio mondiale, sulla necessità di non omologare tutto e tutti, per far esprimere una diversità che è ricchezza. Pertanto la missione culturale del museo consiste nel far 
conoscere tradizioni, abitudini e principi di diversi popoli, così come far luce sulle trasformazioni sociali, artistiche e spirituali in atto nell'Africa subsahariana.<br>

Fondato nel 1974 da Don Giacomo Piazzoli, primo parroco di Brembo, appassionato collezionista e presepista, il Museo del Presepio di Dalmine raccoglie, conserva e valorizza una 
collezione unica al mondo che ruota tutta attorno al tema della natività. Il percorso museale si articola su due piani e ospita oltre 900 presepi differenti per epoca, 
provenienza, dimensione e materiale. Le opere più antiche, risalenti al Settecento, all’Ottocento e al primo Novecento, testimoniano la varietà di stili, materiali e tipologia di 
composizione delle varie Scuole Italiane.<br>

Il Museo dei Tasso e della Storia Postale è stato fondato nel 1991, in due edifici storici del borgo medievale di Cornello. Cornello fu il luogo d’origine della famiglia Tasso, 
nota in tutto il mondo per l'opera letteraria di Torquato Tasso e per l'abilità imprenditoriale di alcuni suoi esponenti, che fondarono e gestirono per secoli il servizio postale 
europeo. Il Museo è articolato in quattro spazi espositivi, ognuno dei quali sviluppa e approfondisce la storia postale e la storia della famiglia Tasso. Qui, infatti, sono 
conservati numerosi documenti legati alla loro attività e, in generale, alla storia postale, tra cui una lettera del 1840 affrancata con il primo francobollo emesso al mondo: il 
Penny Black.<br>

La Pinacoteca, inaugurata nel 2002, nasce da una donazione di circa 150 opere, per la maggior parte quadri d'epoca compresa tra il 1500 e il 1700, che un grande appassionato 
d'arte, don Gianni Bellini, ha raccolto nella sua vita per donarli poi alla comunità di Sarnico. Oltre ai dipinti, fanno parte della donazione alcuni pregiati mobili d'epoca, 
interessanti statue marmoree e lignee e quattro crocifissi "processionali" di grande interesse. La Pinacoteca è collocata nella parte più antica di Palazzo Gervasoni, uno stabile 
del XV sec. sito nel punto più alto del centro storico di Sarnico.<br>

La costituzione di questo museo civico è legata ad alcune donazioni significative: in primis il lascito del fondo del pittore neoclassico Giovan Battista Dell'Era, di origine 
trevigliese. Nel 1961 l'ex sindaco neurochirurgo Pier Luigi Della Torre donò. Comune di Treviglio la propria collezione, con l'espressa volontà testamentaria di disporla in una 
costituenda Pinacoteca cittadina, da intitolarsi alla memoria dei genitori, Ernesto e Teresa Della Torre. Da segnalare il gruppo dipinti del XV e XVI sec., una selezione di 
dipinti Ottocenteschi, un gruppo di opere scultoree, di miniature e di stampe di varie epoche.<br>

Negli anni ottanta del secolo scorso, un giovane agricoltore, il sig. Andrea Baraldini, iniziò a raccogliere oggetti e attrezzi appartenuti al mondo contadino che testimoniavano 
un modo di lavorare e di vivere ormai al tramonto. Nell'arco di un ventennio, grazie alla sua pazienza e perseveranza, egli riuscì a raccogliere oltre duemila pezzi, tanti da 
convincere l'amministrazione a individuare un luogo in cui esporre il materiale per consentire alla popolazione di conoscerlo. Il Museo del Territorio è un museo etnoantropologico 
che conserva le testimonianze della civiltà contadina di fine 1800-inizio 1900.<br>

L'antico mulino, che sorge lungo il torrente che scende dalla Valle dei Mulini, è un edificio di origine cinquecentesca, nato come segheria e poi trasformato in mulino. Attivo 
sino agli anni '60 del secolo scorso, era stato poi abbandonato, ed è stato fortunatamente recuperato dall'attuale proprietario, appassionato raccoglitore di oggetti e attrezzi 
legati sia all'attività del mulino sia all'attività agricola montana. Sede oggi di un ristorante, il Museo occupa i due piani sottostanti il livello stradale.<br>

Il borgo di Oneta è una località tipicamente medievale con vie in acciotolato, case porticate, costruite in pietra e legno. In una suggestiva piazzetta spicca un edificio di 
particolare eleganza risalente al XV sec. noto come "Casa di Arlecchino". La Casa fu un tempo dimora dei nobili Grataroli, la cui ascesa è legata anche alle vicende degli Zanni, 
servitori bergamaschi nella città lagunare. Nella seconda metà del Cinquecento fu proprio un bergamasco, Alberto Ganassa, a vestire i panni di Arlecchino davanti ai re di Francia 
e Spagna. Carica di queste memorie, la casa di Arlecchino rivendica dunque una ragionevole sedimentazione dei presupposti ambientali e culturali che la animarono e la resero 
protagonista nei teatri di piazza e corte.<br>

Il Museo di Arte Sacra San Nicolò è nato grazie alla volontà del sacerdote Luiselli che, durante la sua permanenza nella città, ha raccolto e restaurato molti oggetti e arredi 
sacri dislocati in diverse chiese e che, altrimenti, sarebbero andati perduti. Il percorso museale è stato allestito nelle due sacrestie della Chiesa Parrocchiale e in alcun spazi 
appositamente realizzati: nella prima sacrestia sono esposti molti dipinti e affreschi realizzati da artisti famosi, alcuni risalenti al '600; nella seconda è possibile ammirare 
un enorme armadio che occupa tutte e quattro le pareti della sala, opera dei fratelli Caniana, caratterizzato da meravigliosi intarsi e numerosi ritratti di sacerdoti che hanno 
diretto la parrocchia in passato.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> Durante l’apertura della chiesa parrocchiale.<br>

Nel Museo MBPM, inaugurato nel 2007, la breve vita di Pierina è raccontata lungo un percorso, lungo il quale il visitatore tuttavia, guidato dalle frasi che Pierina amava 
appuntare sui suoi quaderni, riuscirà a percepire il suo distacco per le cose terrene desiderosa solo di seguire il percorso indicatole da Gesù e riservatole da Dio. Il percorso 
cronologico museale parte indifferentemente dalla sua vita quotidiana o dalla sua morte terrena e si conclude in un luogo di luce. Nella cappellina che verrà costruita e a lei 
dedicata. Un luogo scevro da ogni legame con questa terra, unico protagonista il crocefisso nella luce. Il museo si trova al pian terreno della casa parrocchiale e vi si può 
accedere direttamente anche dalla chiesa.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> Ogni domenica dalle 14.30 alle 18.00.<br>

Il Museo Civico di Scienze Naturali, intitolato al suo primo direttore Enrico Caffi, nasce nel 1918 da nuclei di collezioni geologiche, botaniche, zoologiche ed etnografiche 
provenienti da donazioni di privati e dal gabinetto scientifico del Regio Istituto Tecnico. Nel corso degli anni il Museo ha organizzato e ampliato i propri spazi e le proprie 
raccolte per incrementare il settore espositivo e sviluppare una più intensa attività didattica e di ricerca.<br>

L'Orto Botanico è un'istituzione municipale inaugurata nel 1972 dovuta all'opera dei due principali promotori: Luciano Malanchini e Guido Isnenghi. Dopo un periodo di crisi 
gestionale, negli ultimi anni l'Orto Botanico è cresciuto sia in termini di attività che di consensi, tanto che i visitatori sono aumentati progressivamente fino a superare i 
15.000 annui.<br>

Nel 1965, nell'area dell'attuale Parco, un'ampia frana mise in luce un eccezionale giacimento fossilifero: uno dei più interessanti siti paleontologici a livello internazionale. 
E' del 1973 la clamorosa scoperta dello scheletro perfettamente conservato di Eudimorphodon ranzii, il più antico Pterosauro al mondo. Questi reperti sono oggi conservati presso 
il Museo di Scienze Naturali "E. Caffi" di Bergamo che ne ha seguito, sin dall'inizio, le ricerche e le campagne di scavo. <br>

La chiesa di San Rocco posta in piazza Insurrezione è dedicata al culto, particolarmente diffuso nella pianura bergamasca, dell'omonimo santo. Il santo, a causa delle sue 
vicissitudini, era in passato invocato contro la peste. Questa chiesa risalirebbe, come gran parte delle chiese dedicate a San Rocco, al 1630.<br>

E' stata edificata nel corso del XVII secolo in un terreno allora noto come Gemone, ove era situato il principale cimitero degli appestati del 1630, per volere di Giuseppe 
Locatelli. Nel 1668 fu ampliata grazie all'apertura di una cappella intitolata a San Francesco Saverio. Nel corso del XIX secolo l'edificio venne nuovamente rimaneggiato, sia 
nella facciata che nei suoi interni che nel campanile di cui fu dotato.<br>

All'interno del Parco del Roccolo o si incontra una chiesetta in stile neogotico. La chiesetta, la più piccola a Treviglio, fu edificata nel 1900 ad opera dei fratelli Pescali che 
trovarono nel loro campo una radice a forma di croce: ritenendolo un evento miracoloso fecero costruire la chiesetta intitolandola a Gesù Redentore. In seguito venne adottata 
dagli Scout trevigliesi e poi dagli Alpini, che tutt’ora detengono la manutenzione del parco.<br>

Considerata il più importante monumento di Bergamo, la Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore venne eretta nel 1100 per voto alla Madonna. La chiesa ha conservato all'esterno, con 
alcune aggiunte, la struttura romanica originaria a croce greca. All'interno si è arricchita dei contributi di otto secoli. Accanto agli affreschi, si possono ammirare lo 
splendido confessionale in legno capolavoro di Andrea Fantoni, le tarsie del coro di Lorenzo Lotto, gli arazzi fiorentini e fiamminghi e la tomba d Donizetti. L'arredo più 
prestigioso dell'altare maggiore è la preziosa croce d'argento, detta di Ughetto, che risale al '300. <br>

In ambito religioso riveste notevole importanza il Duomo, dedicato ai Santi Nazario e Celso, risalente alla fine del XVIII secolo e contenente opere di notevole valore, tra cui 
spiccano gli affreschi di Vincenzo Angelo Orelli, la Pietà del Tintoretto e il dipinto San Nazario e Celso condannati alle verghe eseguito da Enrico Scuri. Esternamente si 
presenta con una facciata in pietra e con un campanile, detto campanile del Cagnola, in stile neoclassico ed alto ben 54 metri. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identità" nel PTCP

Il Santuario dedicato alla Madonna delle Grazie sorge poco sopra Piazza Moretto. Opera di sommo rilievo storico è l’organo (1636) di Giovanni Rogantino di Morbegno (SO). L’altare 
è costruito sul luogo ove avvenne la prodigiosa apparizione della Madonna. Nel 1645 iniziarono i lavori di costruzione dell’alto campanile (66 metri) che venne definitivamente 
ultimato vent’anni dopo.<br>

L’antico Monastero di Astino si trova nel territorio comunale di Bergamo, ai piedi del versante sud-ovest dei colli sui quali sorge il nucleo antico della cittá. La fondazione del 
monastero risale al 1070 ad opera di monaci vallombrosani sotto la guida dell’abate Bertario. La Fondazione MIA e il Comune di Bergamo, con la collaborazione di altri soggetti 
pubblici e privati, hanno iniziato nel 2008 un percorso progettuale per la definizione di destinazioni d'uso pubbliche e compatibili con le caratteristiche culturali e ambientali 
del complesso. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identitá" nel PTCP della provincia di Bergamo. <br>

Il Santuario ha origine da un fatto prodigioso: siamo nel 1522 quando in Lombardia si combatte la guerra tra francesi e spagnoli. I trevigliesi non vedono altra salvezza 
dall'assedio francese che nell'intervento della Madonna. Si raccomandano in preghiera e vedono la venerata immagine spargere abbondanti lacrime e sudore. Le lacrime della Vergine 
salvano la città di Treviglio dal saccheggio e dalla vendetta dei francesi. Il miracolo si verifica la mattina del 28 febbraio 1522. La prima pietra del nucleo originario del 
Santuario viene posta il 25 marzo 1594, su progetto dell'architetto romano Tolomeo Rinaldi.<br>

Di struttura imponente, con i suoi 76 metri di lunghezza, 36 di larghezza, 64 di altezza è per dimensioni la seconda della Lombardia, superata solo dal Duomo di Milano. Il 
progetto iniziale della chiesa risale al XVIII sec., ma fu terminata soltanto nel 1880. Di notevole bellezza è la cupola ricoperta da lavagne di Savoia, mentre iI dipinti dei 
pennacchi della cupola furono realizzati dal Trecourt e rifatti nel 1876 da Antonio Guadagnini. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identità" nel PTCP della provincia di Bergamo. <br>

Piccolo gioiello di storia e architettura romanica conservato nel verde collinare del Monte Canto, l'abbazia di S. Egidio affascina i visitatori per la sua eleganza e l'atmosfera 
medievale che pervade le sue pietre. Situato in una zona ancor oggi tranquilla e riparata dalla frenesia moderna, questo monastero venne edificato nel 1080 dal feudatario 
bergamasco Alberto da Prezzate, già fondatore del monastero di Pontida. L'attività del monastero fu fiorente fino al X sec. quando pian piano si spense. Cominciò di nuovo a 
rifiorire nella seconda metà del XX sec. grazie a padre David Maria Turoldo, che vi fondò un centro di spiritualità. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identità" nel PTCP della

L’origine della Basilica viene fatta risalire, secondo una tradizione riportata dagli storiografi ma non documentata, ai sec. V e VI, quando all'esterno del nucleo fortificato era 
presente una piccola chiesa dedicata alla B.V. Assunta. Nella navata destra è collocato il Polittico di Zenale e Butinone: esso rappresenta un prezioso documento di storia 
dell'arte lombarda, segnando il passaggio tra gotico e rinascimentale. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identità" nel PTCP della provincia di Bergamo.<br>

La fondazione dell’Abbazia risale al 1079, quando Giselberto, appartenente ad un ramo della famiglia dei conti di Bergamo, stipula l'atto di donazione a favore del convento di San 
Pietro a Cluny di un terreno attiguo al monte Argon, affinché vi sia eretto un monastero dedicato agli Apostoli Paolo e Pietro. Attualmente il Monastero è al centro di un grande 
progetto di riqualificazione: la prima tappa, in cui sono coinvolti tutti i principali enti territoriali, è la completa ristrutturazione del complesso. Saranno inoltre attivati il 
Museo delle Migrazioni e il primo Polo Formativo per la Nautica da diporto. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identità" nel PTCP della provincia di Bergamo.<br>

Secondo la tradizione il Santuario fu edificato nel 1166 per ex-voto su una tribulina preesistente da un gruppo di mercanti irlandesi rifugiatisi a Colzate, proprio sulla cima del 
monte Cavlera, per sfuggire agli imperiali di Barbarossa. Già in epoca medievale i mercanti anglosassoni erano consoni acquistare lana pregiata, coperte e tessuti a Vertova e 
Gandino, per poi commerciarli in Britannia. Il santuario fu poi ampliato e abbellito in varie epoche dagli abitanti del luogo in segno di devozione. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi

Il Santuario, posto su uno dei declivi boscosi della Val San Martino, risale al 1683, ed è sotto la giurisdizione dei Monaci Benedettini dell'Abbazia di Pontida, fondata da 
sant'Alberto da Prezzate nel 1076. Nel 1876, l'intervento materno della Madonna, in seguito a un voto fatto da tutta la popolazione, stroncava una misteriosa malattia che colpiva 
tutte le gestanti e le partorienti. Da allora non è mai venuta meno la processione votiva annuale al Santuario di Caderizzi, soprattutto da parte delle spose e delle mamme, nel 
Venerdì della prima settimana di Passione. <br>

Il Santuario di Ghisalba è sorto per volontà della Madonna, che apparve, ad una anziana donna del paese, il 14 agosto 1453. Come segno dell'apparizione la povera Tonolla avrebbe 
portato infisso nella gola il coltello che teneva in mano, e non avrebbe potuto estrarlo fino a che il popolo non avesse deliberato l'edificazione della cappella. All'esterno 
della chiesa, sulla facciata laterale, si nota un affresco del miracolo del 1494, all'interno un affresco del 1500. Nell'abside si trova un grande dipinto del 1684 di Giovan 
Battista Soldani, che attesta il miracolo. <br>

Il Santuario fu progettato dall’ing.mons.Spirito M.Chiapetta e venne consacrato da mons.Tredici il 1 ottobre 1938. E’ dedicato a Cristo, Re dei Vergini, in onore delle sante 
Bartolomea Capitanio, fondatrice dell’Istituto delle Suore di Carità e Vincenza Gerosa, continuatrice dell’opera. Nel suo complesso architettonico, scultoreo, pittorico il tempio 
esalta il valore della verginità consacrata, con vetrate,affreschi e mosaici. La pala dell’abside centrale rappresenta le due Sante di Lovere che vengono incoronate da Cristo. La 
festa liturgica delle Sante, che è anche la festa patronale di Lovere, viene celebrata solennemente il 18 maggio.<br>

Il Santuario di Sombreno non è ancora conosciuto quanto meriterebbe, nel corso degli ultimi anni ha comunque conquistato fama e prestigio sempre più elevato. Meta tradizionale dei 
fedeli del posto e recentemente centro di interesse locale e nazionale, esso costituisce uno degli esempi più cospicui di quei luoghi sacri che la pietà popolare della nostra 
gente ha eretto nei secoli sul nostro territorio. La mirabile posizione sull’estremo sperone occidentale dei colli di Bergamo, lo rendono facilmente riconoscibile, e quindi 
familiare, per le comunità che si trovano nel territorio del Parco. Per questi motivi il Parco dei Colli ha voluto promuovere interventi di restauro che hanno restituito il 
Santuario al suo originario splendore. <br>

Su una collina situata alle pendici del monte Farno, in posizione dominante l'altopiano di Casnigo e la Valle Seriana, sorge il Santuario della SS. Trinità. L'edificio pare sia 
stato costruito in tre diversi momenti, con il corpo più antico, antecedente il 1491, oggi inglobato nel portico antistante l'entrata della chiesa. Sul timpano murario che 
conclude l'aula cinquecentesca, sopra l'arco trionfale a tutto sesto che definisce l'abside, è dipinto un grande affresco di ben 39 mq raffigurante il Giudizio Universale, 
recentemente attribuito a Cristoforo Baschenis il Vecchio.<br>

Il santuario della Madonna d'Erbia si trova sul monte dell'Erbia, nel territorio del comune di Casnigo. La nascita del santuario della Madonna d'Erbia e il culto per la Vergine ad 
esso associato devono il loro affermarsi a due avvenimenti prodigiosi (avvenuti nel 1550 e nel 1839). Tra le reliquie che il santuario conserva, spicca la veste talare indossata 
da Papa Giovanni Paolo II nella sua ultima apparizione in Piazza San Pietro. <br>

Il Santuario si trova nel territorio del Comune di Oneta, in Valle del Riso ed è situato alle pendici dell’Alben su una collinetta a quota 954 m. Il luogo trae origine dall’antico 
toponimo “Frasen”, attestato già nell’estimo del 1472, con il quale la gente di Oneta individua tuttora un colle, sul quale un tempo vi era forse un maestoso frassino. La presenza 
del grande frassino può avere suggestionato la fantasia dei primi abitanti che finirono per chiamare il posto con lo specifico nome dell’albero. Tale appellativo non deve trarre 
in inganno poiché il miracolo della Madonna del Frassino non ha nulla a che vedere con una “Madonna arborea”, cioè la Vergine Maria apparsa su un albero<br>

La tradizione fa risalire la fondazione della chiesa all’8 dicembre 1374 per volontà del nobile Bernardo Vitalba, che sul colle aveva il suo castello. Per secoli la chiesa rimase 
di proprietà della famiglia Vitalba e solo nel 1847 fu trasferita alla Fabbriceria della Parrocchia di Nembro. Lungo la mulattiera che sale alla chiesa vi sono le tribuline dei 
Misteri del Rosario, documentate nel 1738 ma probabilmente erette nella metà del ‘600. La festa patronale, particolarmente frequentata dai nembre ricorre l'8 agosto.<br>

Nel santuario di Altino è inglobata la fonte d’acqua che è all’origine del fatto miracoloso del 1496. Nel 1575, all’epoca della visita di S.Carlo Borromeo, sul luogo si trovava un 
edificio che aveva probabilmente già subito un primo ampliamento. L’aspetto attuale del Santuario è il risultato di una serie di iniziative che sono state intraprese a partire 
dalla fine del XIX secolo. L’interno è diviso in 3 navate da pilastri poco slanciati che reggono la copertura con volte a crocera costolo. All’esterno l’elemento caratterizzante è 
il profondo portico. <br>

A metà strada tra l'abitato di Pradalunga e le antiche cave di pietre si trova il Santuario della Forcella il cui nome deriva dal luogo di passaggio sulla famosa antica strada 
Mercatorum. Durante la peste del 1630 gli abitanti di Pradalunga fecero votodi costruire un santuario sul Colle della Forcella, dedicata alla Madona della Neve, riconosciuta una 
figura sacra dai lavoratori delle cave. Tra le note religiose che hanno conferito al Santuario un'attenzione tale da portare a fenomeni di pellegrinaggio, sono da menzionare gli 
ex-voto di cui il Santuario è riccamente decorato: ve ne sono ben cinquanta; alcuni di autori ignoti, molti di pittori sconosciuti ed altri di esecutori meglio apprezzati. <br>

Il Santuario della Madonna delle Caneve (= cantine), costituisce uno dei piu' bei ricordi dell'infanzia di Papa Giovanni XXIII, che vi si recava spesso, accompagnato dalla madre: 
qui ha celebrato per l'ultima volta il 26 agosto 1958, due mesi prima di essere eletto papa. Il piccolo Santuario delle Caneve, di origine trecentesca, si trova alle falde del 
Monte Canto; è preceduto da un portico a quattro colonne, ha un'alta finestra nella facciata e all'interno si venera una bella Madonna con Bambino.<br>

Il santuario della Basella nei pressi di Urgnano, nella media pianura bergamasca, fu edificato a ricordo di una apparizione della Madonna avvenuta nel 1356. Verso il 1460, 
Bartolomeo Colleoni provvide a un ampliamento della chiesa, alla quale venne annesso un convento di frati domenicani, inviati nel 1462 dal monastero di Santo Stefano di Bergamo, 
con incarico di assistenza e custodia del santuario.<br>

Il Santuario della Madonna dei Campi, si trova nella campagna attorno a Stezzano, a 5 chilometri da Bergamo. Secondo la tradizione esisteva una cappella con l'immagine della 
Madonna, alla quale i contadini erano molto devoti. Un giorno di otto secoli fa, una donna vi scorse una gran luce e le apparve la Madonna con il Bambino. Fu costruita una 
chiesetta dove nel maggio del 1586 da un pilastro con affrescata la Madonna incominciò a sgorgare acqua; il 12 luglio successivo la Madonna comparve a due bambine di Stezzano.

Venturina Bonelli, una piccola contadina di 12 anni, soffriva da tempo alla gamba sinistra a causa di una cancrena. L'unico rimedio, ormai, era l'amputazione dell'arto, ma la 
madre si rifiutò e portò la giovane davanti all'Altare della Madonna, nella Chiesa della Ripa, dove pregarono e piansero. Dopo alcune ore, Venturina ebbe l'apparizione della Madre 
di Dio, che le curò miracolosamente la gamba inferma, guarendola completamente. Era il 9 ottobre 1440. Per ringraziare la Vergine, la famiglia, Bonelli e la popolazione del 
piccolo paese ingrandirono e decorarono la Chiesa della Ripa, invocando al Miracolo della Madonna. Nel 1579 la casa dove avvenne l'apparizione fu trasformata in chiesetta, 
divenendo in seguito il futuro Santuario.<br>

In direzione di Calcio si trova il santuario della Madonna della Rotonda che, opera di Pellegrino Tibaldi ed eretto in occasione di un’apparizione mariana. In una scrittura sopra 
una lapide di marmo alla Rotonda si legge: "Il 24 maggio 1585 Maria Santissima apparve qui e disse al vecchio campagnolo sordomuto Francesco Zamboni, che qui per la prima volta 
acquistò l’udito: Dirai al tuo signore che qui mi dedichi un tempio. A tanto prodigio il conte Francesco Barbò e tutti credettero”.<br>

Cornabusa, in dialetto bergamasco, significa rupe-grotta: il santuario è uno degli esempi più impressionanti in Italia di chiesa situata all’interno di una caverna in cui sgorga 
una sorgente d'acqua. Nel XV secolo, in piena lotta fra Guelfi e Ghibellini, una semplice donna nascose in una caverna un’immagine dell’Addolorata. Una ragazza sordomuta, entrata 
per curiosità nella grotta, trovò l'effigie della Vergine e lo annunciò ai suoi famigliari ottenendo così la guarigione. <br>

La basilica di Santa Maria Assunta di Clusone è un edificio monumentale del XVIII secolo. È posta in una posizione panoramica, con una scenografica scalinata sul lato meridionale 
decorata da grandi statue degli evangelisti e da balaustre. A oriente della chiesa si alza il campanile, costruito qualche decennio prima della chiesa, che costituisce l'elemento 
architettonico più visibile dell‘altopiano di Clusone. Il lato meridionale della basilica  è dotato anche  di un portico classicheggiante, mentre il lato occidentale si affaccia 
di fronte all‘Oratorio dei Disciplini. L'interno della basilica è ad aula unica e presenta opere d'arte di diversi pittori e scultori bergamaschi. L’Oratorio dei Disciplini  è una 
costruzione quattrocentesca preceduta da portico, che conserva esternamente pregevoli e famosi affreschi del 1485 (Trionfo della morte e Danza macabra) del pittore clusonese 
Giacomo Borlone de Buschis.<br>

L'erezione del tempio come tuttora lo si vede iniziò nel 1575 voluto dall'allora arcivescovo Carlo Borromeo. A edificarlo fu chiamato l'architetto Pellegrino Tibaldi, detto il 
Pellegrini. L'opera di costruzione continuò, non senza interruzioni, fino ai primi decenni del Settecento. La basilica sorge in una vasta piazza cinta da portici simmetrici che 
corrono con 200 arcate per uno sviluppo di quasi 800 metri. Nel piazzale antistante il Viale si trovano l'obelisco e una fontana lunga quasi 50 metri.<br>

Questo caratteristico edificio romanico fu eretto in un luogo considerato sacro già dall'età tardo romana, quando vi esisteva un'area sepolcrale. La costruzione della basilica 
risale all'inizio del XII sec., ma già nel 1370 Bernabò Visconti depredò costruzione di molte pietre che utilizzò per completare l'edificazione del proprio castello a Trezzo 
sull'Adda. Della basilica oggi sopravvivono solo il presbiterio, le tre absidi e la prima campata delle tre navate. Nonostante i pochi resti, la basilica di S. Giulia rappresenta 
uno dei monumenti romanici più interessanti della provincia e crea attorno a sé un'atmosfera decisamente suggestiva. Sito aggiunto ai "Luoghi dell'identità" nel PTCP della 
provincia di Bergamo.<br>

Il complesso di Santa Maria della Consolazione si trova in una posizione incantevole sulla sommità della collina di Umbriana, circondato a est e a sud da vigneti, a ovest 
dall'antico insediamento della Porta. È costituito da tre corpi di fabbrica:
la chiesa con la sagrestia del XV secolo; il campanile completato sulla fine del XVI secolo; il monastero con il chiostro, sempre datato al primi anni del ‘500. <br>

Il 25 novembre 1881, nel Palazzo dei proprietà dei conti Morlani, nacque Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, quartogenito di tredici figli. La patriarcale famiglia Roncalli si trasferì nel 
1893 nel vicino edificio della Colombera. Attualmente la casa natale, custodita dai padri del PIME, è un museo di ricordi dedicato a Papa Giovanni XXIII e alle sue umili 
tradizioni. Nelle vicinanze della casa natale sorge il Seminario del PIME, società di vita apostolica composta da missionari. E' inoltre presente una pinacoteca, composta da una 
serie di opere pittoriche che l'artista Natale Bertuletti ha donato al PIME per onorare la memoria del grande Pontefice.<br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> 8.30-17.30 (invernale) o 18.30 (estivo). <br>

L’edificio che ospita il Museo è ubicato in pieno centro storico all’interno delle mura medievali. Gli stabili di questa zona anticamente a vocazione commerciale, con strade 
adiacenti totalmente porticate a servizio dei tre mercati settimanali, appartenevano a ricche e nobili famiglie: i Suardi, gli Agazi, i Calusco. L’insieme del grande complesso 
ecclesiastico della comunità parrocchiale costituisce di per sé un museo con le sue architetture, gli apparati decorativi e le importanti opere d’arte ivi conservate <br>
<br>
<b>Orari di apertura:</b> Mer e gio: 9.30 - 12.30; ven, sab, dom e festivi: 9.30 - 12.30 - 15.00 - 19.30; Natale, Pasqua, S. Stefano e Capodanno: 16.00 - 19.30<br>

Come accade anche in altre antiche parrocchie, l’attuale chiesa di Vertova è frutto di numerosi rimaneggiamenti e ricostruzioni che nei secoli si sono rincorsi portati dai 
cambiamenti di gusto e di stile. Al semplice candore esterno si contrappone il fastosissimo interno barocco strutturato con un’ampia navata centrale, affiancata da due navatelle 
minori che raccordano le cappelle degli altari laterali con l’aula centrale.<br>

Dallo scambio con Venezia ebbero origine alcune significative vicende come il lungo rapporto tra Lorenzo Lotto e Bergamo, che vi soggiornò per dieci anni - dal 1513 al 1523 -, e 
che l’ebbe cara come sua seconda patria. A questa sua presenza sono legati i capolavori di cui la Bergamasca è ricca. Una grande mostra su Lorenzo Lotto che si tenne a Bergamo 
nella primavera di poco più di dieci anni fa offrì l’occasione per tracciare, sulla base delle sue opere e sulla ricostruzione della Bergamo com’era nel Cinquecento, un 
“itinerario lottesco”, che attraversa l’intera città. E possiamo farlo ancora oggi comodamente a piedi, partendo da piazza Vecchia.<br>

Questo itinerario, che si sviluppa in 3 tappe (Monasterolo, Gaverina Terme e Vigano S. Martino) è un viaggio alla scoperta delle opere della famiglia Fantoni. I Fantoni furono una 
famiglia di scultori ed intagliatori, originaria di Rovetta, operante dal secolo XV al XIX e attiva principalmente nel bergamasco. Andrea, primogenito di Graziosi, capobottega già 
dal 1682, perfezionò l’organizzazione gerarchica del lavoro; egli fu l’esponente più importante della famiglia, riuscendo a fare convivere la severità dell’impianto iconografico 
con una raffinata fantasia decorativa.<br>

Nato a Bergamo, più precisamente nel piccolo Borgo di Canale, il 29 novembre 1797, Gaetano Donizetti vi compì i primi studi di musica, per poi trascorrere buona parte della vita a 
Napoli, ma negli ultimi anni fu a Parigi; sempre con una grande nostalgia per Bergamo, dove tornò per morirvi l’8 aprile del 1848.<br>
